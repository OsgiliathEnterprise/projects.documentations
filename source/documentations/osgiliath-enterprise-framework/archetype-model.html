It's purpose is to make the database access available, it can also exposes Dao's as services.
It's composed of two modules: a database one and a model one.
<article>
<header>
<H2 id="database">Database module</H2>
</header>
Here you can specify your database access configuration and expose the connections as OSGI services that will be consumed by the model module.

By default Derby databases are supported, but you can tweak it to support Oracle, Mysql, PostGres, HSQL...

The database configuration file must be located in the src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/&lt;whatever&gt;.xml

Here's how to declare a datasource bean:
{% gist 801d489902168369e2d1 %}

 Here's how to expose the database as a service without transaction support:
    {% gist 375819345e1b7d6217f0 %}
And with transactional support:
    {% gist ed07aa38cebc41694d88 %}


Defining an other kind of datasource:

You must define a new feature on the parent project features list (see features sub-module), containing the OSGI compliant database driver (in order to see if it's OSGI compliant, check the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file on the jar, it must contains an Export-Package  section.
Then, modify the osgi.bnd file of the database module removing the org.apache.derby.jdbc package import and adding those of your driver.

Finally change the dataSource bean declaration in the blueprint file.

Also, if you changed something on the datasource definition, you'll also have to modify the datasource linkage in the model pom.xml (the parent of the jpa and database one).

<article>
<header>
<H2 id="jpa">JPA module</H2>
</header>
The model module is here to define your model objects (those which will be persisted) as well as the method for accessing them.

<p><h3>Datasource connection definition</h3><br/>
Edit the src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml file of your module and change the &lt;jta-data-source&gt;osgi:service/jdbc/${project.parent.artifactId}.database.xa&lt;/jta-data-source&gt; and the &lt;non-jta-data-source&gt; Sections (referencing the non xa exported one).
If you want to disable the transactional access, you've also to change the 'transaction-type' value to 'RESOURCE_LOCAL'
</p>
<p>
<h3>Model object definition</h3><br/>
In order to define a new model object, you've got to extends the 'AbstractEntity' abstract class on your src/main/java folder.
All Java files that are located on this folder will be 'delombokized' e.g they will interpret the lombok annotations and generate the according Java code.
Here's an example of a model entity:
{% gist db59c28832bb3c1f67f8 %}

Then reference this class on the &lt;class&gt; section of the src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml file
</p>
<p>
<h3>Declaring DAOs</h3><br/>
In order to declare a Data Access Object its API via an interface:
{% gist 346ce65959d8876f7c63%}

Then, with the help of spring data jpa, that make all the basic operations available, you've to code a very small implementation:
    {% gist 85c5c141dc8581242794%}

</p>
<p>
Finally, you've to define the bean wiring on the src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/<whatever>.xml
{% gist 36a228726b40da2cfb35 %}

You can also expose this bean on the OSGI service registry as follow:
{% gist c1fde63ac0d3baffa517 %}

<H3 id="tweak">Adding JMS, REST or integration Tests to the JPA module</H3>
</header>
In order to add REST or JMS support to the JPA module, remove all net.osgiliath features on the pom.xml and add this one:
{% codeblock lang:xml %}
<dependency>
	<groupId>net.osgiliath.framework</groupId>
	<version>${osgiliath.framework.maven.version}</version>
	<artifactId>net.osgiliath.features.karaf-features-full</artifactId>
	<type>xml</type>
	<classifier>features</classifier>
</dependency>
{% endcodeblock %}
And the same for your projects feature (in the features module of your parent pom).
Then, add these lines on your osgi.bnd Import-Package section:
{% codeblock lang:xml %}
 org.springframework.transaction,\
 javax.transaction,\
 org.apache.camel,\
 org.springframework.validation.beanvalidation,\
 *
{% endcodeblock %}
For JMS, and the following for REST:
{% codeblock lang:xml %}
 org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.provider,\
 org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.provider.json,\
 org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.impl.tl,\
 helpers.cxf.exception.handling.jaxrs.mapper,\
 *
{% endcodeblock %}
Finally, follow the REST, JMS or Itests sections of the business module documentation
