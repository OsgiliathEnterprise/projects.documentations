A technical documentation will automatically be generated for your project.
In order to do this, just run
    mvn -Preporting site site:stage
This will generate:
* Javadoc
* JXR (Java cross references)
* Useful project info report

This will copy any of your readme.md file situated in your project root in the src/site/markdown folder of your project in order to have access on it in the doc

After configuring the distributionConfiguration i.e.
    <site>
        <id>github-pages</id>
        <name>Github GH Pages</name>
        <url>scm:git:git@github.com:OsgiliathEnterprise/net.osgiliath.parent.git</url>
    </site>
